Notes:
  N is any integer 
Bitwise XOR:
	If N is Odd:
		N ^ 1 => N-1  (Decreased by 1)
	If N is Even:
		N ^ 1 => N+1  (Increased by 1)

	XOR with 0:
		N ^ 0 => N (No change)
		N ^ N => 0 ( XOR operation between a number N and itself (N ^ N),
			 the result will always be 0)
			

Bitwise AND:
	 As we know bitwise AND Operation of a Number by 1 will be 1,
  	  After AND operation with the number if we get 1 that means
   	  number is Odd else Even.

Bitwise OR:
	If N is Odd:
		N | 1 => N	 (No change)
	If N is Even:
		N | 1 => N+1 (Increased by 1)
